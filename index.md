# Diving Deeper with ArcGIS Online StoryMaps

## Goals

This workshop builds off of the fundamentals learned in the workshop [Visualizing Data in ArcGIS Online](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-AGOL/), focusing on creating StoryMaps with the ArcGIS Online platform and tools. This workshop is intended for those with introductory knowledge or experience with ArcGIS Online but looking for advanced features and functions of StoryMaps. There are three main sections:

1. Adding and exploring data from local and ArcGIS Online
2. Reviewing how to create a web map
3. Creating a StoryMap from scratch
